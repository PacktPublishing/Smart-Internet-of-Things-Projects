# Smart Internet of Things Projects

This is the code repository for [Smart Internet of Things Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/smart-internet-things-projects?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=9781786466518&utm_medium=repository) , published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##Instructions and Navigation

The code included with this book is meant for use as an aid in performing the exercises and should not be used as a replacement for the book itself.
Used out of context, the code may result in an unusable configuration and no warranty is given.

The code will look like the following:
```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import Adafruit_DHT
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

```
